>From the cell phone alarm that wakes them to the tablets used to chat with friends and complete homework, today's students are surrounded by computer technology. It is ubiquitous, and critical to daily routines. Yet few understand how technology works, even as it becomes ever more intrinsic to how we solve business and community challenges.
Today, computer science helps retailers determine how to grow sales, and it ensures that law enforcement officers are in the right places to maintain public safety. It is the foundation for the smart grid, and it fuels personalized medicine initiatives that optimize outcomes and minimize treatment side effects. Computing algorithms help organizations in all industries solve problems in new and more effective ways.

#The Technology gap 

It is become increasing obvious that we have a huge gap today between the amount of technology available and the amount of people who can run, program,  and move the technology forward. Our society’s technology is racing forward at such a pace that we can hardly keep up with it. May of us feel like we just master our phones capabilities, and the next generation is begging for our attention. 
As the technological age races forward we need expand our horizons to keep up with the ever changing needs. Statistics already show that we are lagging behind in the need for those proficient in Computer Science. In the year 2020 it is expected that 1.4M jobs will be available in the U.S. in computer jobs. However the U.S. anticipates having only 400k trained people that will be able to take those positions. This means there will only be about 29% of computer jobs that are filled. This is a staggering statistic. 
With everything moving so quickly we must find ways to close this gap. 
I have heard it said that with the advances of technology, learning to have at least a basic level of understanding of coding could be almost as essential as reading for the rising generation. 

###Educating students in computer science is also beneficial to those not interested in the computer science field. With the digital age rising, there is a need to develop logical thinking and problem-solving which are all a part of the computer science curriculum. Students, regardless of interested field, must be avid in using computers whether it be to create a file, write a report, or researching a certain subject. Not to mention that the job openings with knowledge of computer science is growing in every industry and every state; job opening are projected to grow twice the rate of any job.

##With the lack of available computer science students, will our jobs become outsources to other countries? According to [Hackerrank.com] (https://blog.hackerrank.com/which-country-would-win-in-the-programming-olympics/) when ranking each countries developers according to the top 50 countries the United States does not even fall in the top half.  
How do we rectify this problem? Edutopia.org has 5 action steps now to help students move forward in the technology age. 

1.	Professional Development- There are so many resources available today. Let’s find ways to get these resources connected with the current teachers. 

2.	Career Education – Education Parents, Teachers, and schools about the career opportunities available in the computer science field

3.	Student Incentives – Find a way to give incentives when the students are able to use tools that move computer skills along.

4.	Mentor Programs – Form Mentorship programs that encourage students to work on and develop skills outside of the classroom.

5.	Coding for Kids – Educate and encourage parents to help kids develop confidence in their problem-solving abilities and have them explore computer science in their lives and communities.
